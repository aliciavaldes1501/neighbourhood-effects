Study on neighbourhood effects on the system formed by the perennial plant Gentiana pneumonanthe, its butterfly seed predator Phengaris alcon and the second host of the butterfly, Myrmica ants. 

Data was collected in one population of Gentiana pneumonanthe (Tånga Hed) located in the county of Västra Götaland during the summer of 2016.

A study plot measuring 69 m x 45 m was established on the meadow where the population was located and divided in subplots of 3 x 3 m. All Gentiana plants into the plot were mapped and their phenology and predation intensity recorded. +600 plants were marked where also other reproductive traits, fitness and vegetation height were recorded. At the corners of each subplot with presence of Gentiana plants, temperature (iButtons) and moisture were measured, and samples of ants were collected and identified to the species level in order to calculate host ant abundance. 

Two sub-projects:
- Butterfly perspective
- Plant perspective
