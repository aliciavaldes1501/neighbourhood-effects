Data on abundances of ants in a meadow occupied by a population of Gentiana pneumonanthe

Field data on abundances of ants in a meadow occupied by a population of Gentiana pneumonanthe, collected in Tånga Hed nature reserve in the county of Västra Götaland, SW Sweden (58°01'40.0"N 12°49'47.0"E) in 2016. 

A study plot measuring 69 m × 45 m was established in the meadow occupied by the G. pneumonanthe population. This plot was further divided into 3 m × 3 m subplots with corners permanently marked by wooden poles. The ant community was sampled at each corner of the subplots occupied by G. pneumonanthe (a total of 254 points) at two occasions, 14 July and 3 September. Baits consisted of a 50-ml plastic tube in which we placed a sugar cube. The tubes were left open on the ground in the evening, and collected the next morning. Ants collected were transferred to 70º ethanol and the number of ants of different Myrmica species were counted in the lab (using Douwes, Abenius, Cederberg, & Wahlstedt, 2012 for identification). Ants belonging to other genera where not identified to species, but counted as “other ants”. The abundances were summed between the two sampling dates.
