Data on Gentiana pneumonanthe plant phenology, neighbor density and phenology and number of eggs of Phengaris alcon

Field data on Gentiana pneumonanthe plant phenology, neighbor density and phenology and number of eggs of Phengaris alcon, collected in Tånga Hed nature reserve in the county of Västra Götaland, SW Sweden (58°01'40.0"N 12°49'47.0"E) in 2016. 

A study plot measuring 69 m × 45 m was established in the meadow occupied by the G. pneumonanthe population. This plot was further divided into 3 m × 3 m subplots with corners permanently marked by wooden poles. Plant data was obtained by mapping all reproductive shoots into 154 of the subplots where G. pneumonanthe was present. Phenology and number of eggs of P. alcon were recorded for every reproductive shoot between 29 July and 5 August. 

Field maps were digitized using a Geographic Information System (GIS) created with ArcGIS 10.3.1, assigning relative coordinates to each recorded reproductive shoot of G. pneumonanthe. For each shoot, we defined a buffer zone with a 3-m radius, centered at the focal shoot, and calculated the number of reproductive shoots of G. pneumonanthe per m2 within this buffer zone (“neighbor density”) as well as the mean phenology of these shoots (“neighbor phenology”), excluding in each case the focal shoot. 

Description of each variable in the data file:	
	
FID: Shoot ID
phen: Shoot flowering phenology, recorded as the developmental stage of the most advanced bud, according to six ordinal categories: (1) the sepals covering the bud completely, (2) bud becoming visible, (3) bud growing over the sepals, (4) bud turning blue, (5) flower opening, and (6) flower showing signs of wilting. Each stage corresponds to a time interval of flower development, with higher values indicating a more advanced floral development at the day of recording, i.e. an earlier flowering phenology
x: x coordinate of the shoot in Swedish grid (Rikets Nät, RT 90)
y: y coordinate of the shoot in Swedish grid (Rikets Nät, RT 90)
n_eggs_max: number of P. alcon eggs, counted on the whole shoot
pldens_3: neighbor density (number of reproductive shoots of G. pneumonanthe per m2 within the 3-m buffer zone, excluding the focal shoot)
phen_n3: neighbor phenology (mean phenology of reproductive shoots of G. pneumonanthe within the 3-m buffer zone, excluding the focal shoot)
